Results of number of collision for combination of different "probing and hashing" techniques for task 1 - 

1. Division - Double_hasing 
    No. of collisions -  3527

2. Division - Quadratic_rehash 
    No. of collisions -  3611

3. Multiplicative - Double_hasing 
    No. of collisions -  4211

4. Multiplicative - Quadratic Hashing 
    No. of collisions -  4032

Concluding Division - Double_hashing is most effective of all in reducing number of collisions.
